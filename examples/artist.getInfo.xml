    <content><![CDATA[Maria Viktoria Mena (born February 19, 1986) is a Norwegian pop-rock singer-songwriter.    When Maria was 13 years old she moved to live with her musician father. She sang and wrote lyrics as a form of therapy for her feelings and frustrations. Not all the stories in her diary became songs, but &quot;My Lullaby&quot; was one of them, expressing her pain from her parents' divorce. After pleading with her father to make a demo, he contacted some industry experts to record Maria's songs in the studio. Then he presented his daughter's demo to the music industry. Sony Music signed Maria Mena to their label.  In March 2002, Maria's single &quot;My Lullaby&quot; reached #5 on the Norwegian Charts. The song received heavy rotation on NRK P1, P3, P4, Radio 1 and Radio Oslo. The young singer quickly gained fans and soon earned her first platinum record.  In 2004 she made an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.  2005 saw the release of &quot;Apparently Unaffected&quot;, fronted by singles &quot;Miss You Love&quot; and &quot;Just Hold Me&quot;. A significant success in Norway, the album has earned her three Spellemann nominations, best female artist, best hit and best music video.  After the successes she made in Norway Maria travelled to The Netherlands. There she earned a golden plate for Apparently Unaffected. Also Germany, Austria and Switzerland got some promotion.  In September 2008 Maria's 5th studio album will be released. The title will be 'Cause and Effect'. Her first single was broadcasted for the first time in juni 2008 on the Norwegian radiostation NRK P3.]]></content>
